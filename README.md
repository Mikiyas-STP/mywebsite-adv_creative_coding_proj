# Miki Habesha Cuisine  

Hi,  

Welcome to my Page! This is a website done as a final project for the **Advanced Creative Coding Course**.  

A **responsive website** showcasing **Eritrean cuisine**, built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap**.  

## Things that I implemented and used:  

- **HTML** — Using improved semantic structure.  
- **CSS** — I used flexbox, media queries, custom styling.  
- **JavaScript** — Random "Special of the Day" feature and form submission handling.  
- **Responsive Design** — Using bootstrap grid and media queries.  
- **Bootstrap & Popper** — Used for styling and dynamic positioning.
